6. Go to Screenshot to code and paste it in the Settings dialog under OpenAI key (gear icon). Your key is only stored in your browser. Never stored on our servers.

Some users have also reported that it can take upto 30 minutes after your credit purchase for the GPT4 vision model to be activated.

If you've followed these steps, and it still doesn't work, feel free to open a Github issue.
