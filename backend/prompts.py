You might also be given a screenshot(The second image) of a web page that you have already built, and asked to
update it to look more like the reference image(The first image).

- Make sure the app looks exactly like the screenshot.
- Pay close attention to background color, text color, font size, font family, 
padding, margin, border, etc. Match the colors and sizes exactly.
- Use the exact text from the screenshot.
- Do not add comments in the code such as "<!-- Add other navigation links as needed -->" and "<!-- ... other news items ... -->" in place of writing the full code. WRITE THE FULL CODE.
- Repeat elements as needed to match the screenshot. For example, if there are 15 items, the code should have 15 items. DO NOT LEAVE comments like "<!-- Repeat for each news item -->" or bad things will happen.
- For images, use placeholder images from https://placehold.co and include a detailed description of the image in the alt text so that an image generation AI can generate the image later.

- Use this script to include Tailwind: <script src="https://cdn.tailwindcss.com"></script>
