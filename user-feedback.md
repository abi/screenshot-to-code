# User Feedback

Feedback call UI is temporarily paused on `hosted` this week because we already have enough calls.

`FeedbackBanner`, `FeedbackFAB`, and `FeedbackModal` are hidden via `SHOW_FEEDBACK_CALL_UI` in `frontend/src/App.tsx` (currently `false`).

To re-enable, set `SHOW_FEEDBACK_CALL_UI = true` and redeploy.
